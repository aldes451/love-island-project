# Are you Love Island's "Type on Paper": The Technical Story

We have manually gathered data from the popular UK TV show Love Island and have been providing analytical insights on both the historical and current dataset. 

Check out the analytical findings expressed within the articles below:

## Data Sources and Code
All data and code shared has been manually gathered from public resources listed [here](datasources.md) and also from watching the TV show (series 5) as it happens and prior Love Island series.

This dataset is my own interpretation of the TV show Love Island and how the show has played out over time.
